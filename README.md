Outline for introduction and methods. The project outline will have three sections, Introduction and Methods as well as an Abstract.

## Abstract
* City governments utilize a variety of communication methods and outreach strategies to engage with their communities. They present their citizens with possible resources and assets that have been created with their tax-paying money to ensure there is publicly available relief for them *relief from what?*.  Within the City of New York, communities have been afflicted with rising concerns and situations such as housing due to post-pandemic aftereffects. The socioeconomic landscape has fluctuated for many citizens and the local government of NYC has been establishing relief programs to alleviate and potentially solve each case. Despite the city's efforts to provide resources, many New Yorkers are not taking full advantage of them. This is often due to a lack of awareness or understanding of what's available. This becomes a wasted opportunity for people since the city provides such free resources at the cost of the people’s own taxpayer money. Community engagement is crucial in bridging this gap of awareness. Better understanding of the communication methodologies with the targets communities is necessary to develop more effective outreach strategies. Health communication needs to be analyzed and properly evaluated quantitatively to present the most effective impact that the city can utilize to assist in raising awareness in city resource availability, which would hopefully lead to resource utilization. *language is a bit informal and description of programming is a bit vague* <br/>

## Introduction

*	The aftereffects of post-Covid-19 pandemic remain a strong influence on socioeconomic environment. [The socio-economic implications of the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162753/?report=reader) <br/>
*	Lack of awareness or education for public health resources can be a factor towards a person’s health.  [The relationship between education and health: reducing disparities through a contextual approach](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5880718/) <br/>
*	Large cities and their populations can feel disconnected from their each other due to the metropolitan nature and notable size of the settlement.

*	Communication is a major field that intersects with public health and healthcare. *very vague - what are you trying to say here?* <br/>
* Communication methodologies can strongly influence usage of resources. [Why health communication is important in public health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672574/) <br/>
*	Active participation and civic engagement promote interest and awareness. <br/>
*	Community engagement can lead to empowerment of people in their health and community and overall public health. *vague - what is empowerment here - how is this statement differentiated from the above?* [The effectiveness of community engagement in public health interventions for disadvantaged groups: a meta-analysis](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1352-y) <br/>
*	Communities in NYC can face a variety of challenges to their daily lives such as housing, insurance, that can be assisted or remedied by sources provided by the local government.<br/>
*	Housing-related situations/cases are a rising concern in NYC. Housing and Health: [Housing and Health: Time Again for Public Health Action](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447157/) <br/>
*	Healthcare oriented resources and public health assets are a necessity for city government to provide for its people. [The Right to Health](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Publications/Factsheet31.pdf) <br/>
*	In-person engagements, local print media, and online presence are significant methods of approach towards community outreach.

## Methods
*	I will begin by organizing and cleaning raw data of community engagements provided by data analytics team from the department of NYC Human Resources Administration. <br/>
*	I will break down data into sub-categories to analyze methods of engagement, types of engagements, dates, locations, content/subject/resource highlighted for it. <br/>
*	Utilizing Google analytics, I will analyze the data traffic of Public Engagement Unit’s domain with NYC.gov resource page to find correlations of increased activity in traffic with notable events/dates of engagements. <br/>
*	I will download and organize data from Housing Support Unit (HSU) and Tenant Support Unit) and GetCoveredNYC team (NYC healthcare resource team). <br/>
*	I will analyze resource utilization by checking with each unit’s level of case load/if possible, number of inquiries/page traffic and their correlation with dates with engagements. <br/> 
*	Using publicly available NYC OPENdata, [NYC Benefits Platform: Benefits and Programs Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/NYC-Benefits-Platform-Benefits-and-Programs-Datase/kvhd-5fmu), I will begin to further analyze NYC residents engagement with government resources and programs; further datasets from NYC OPENdata will be analyzed based on relevance to PEU events. <br/>
*	I will draw up a comparative visualization on numbers of outreached citizens per communication methodology if possible. If not, separate visualizations to showcase level of engagement for each communication outreach strategy. *what tools will you use for visualization?* <br/>
